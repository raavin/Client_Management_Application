This is a Rails application the was originally written to allow a welfare service to monitor client participation and allocate each to a worker or program. Originally written in Ruby on Rails 1.2.6, this version has been upgraded to work in Rails 2 (sorry, untested on Rails 3). 

This application needs some work!!

Features:

Add clients
Add Programs
Allocate Client to programs
Show wait time between referral and client engagement
Set client Funding Budget and allocate funding
Add Client Casenotes


Haven't worked on this in a while so happy for anyone to work on it.
